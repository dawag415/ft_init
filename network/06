#In the "/etc" folder, where all system configuration files
#are stored, is the file "resolv.conf". To view the nameserver,
#"cat /etc/resolv.conf".  The command "ls -l /etc/resolv.conf"
#informs us that it is a symlink to "/var/run/resolv.conf",
#the complete path of the File that contains the IP address
#of the DNS server you are using.
ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
